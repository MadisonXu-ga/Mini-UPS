1. Due to the specific nature of Apple and Google sign-in implementations, both require HTTPS for secure connections. 
Apple sign-in, in particular, must be exposed to the public internet to function correctly. 
As a result, using localhost for testing is not feasible in this scenario, and an alternative approach must be taken to ensure proper testing and implementation of these authentication methods.

Solution: To address this issue, we utilized ngrok to expose our local development environment to the public internet. 
However, it is important to note that the public address generated by ngrok is not fixed and may change each time the service is started. 
As a result, we must manually adjust the settings accordingly to ensure proper configuration for Apple and Google sign-in implementations during testing.

2. During the docker setup process, we encountered an issue where the backend was unable to connect to the database. 
However, we were able to resolve this problem by modifying the "localhost" value to "db" in the Hibernate configuration file.

3. During the data transmission process, we encountered a protocol congestion issue where only one message was being read from the socket. 
We were able to resolve the issue by calling the flush function and slowing down the sending rate.
